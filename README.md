# coding_problems

A compilation of solutions to various coding problems, most geared towards competitive programming, from platforms such as [*Codeforces*](https://codeforces.com/) or even IRL contests I have been to, but also some technical interview-like questions from [*LeetCode*](https://leetcode.com/). While all solutions are written by me, some may have been originally solved/written together in a team to which I belonged. Most of this repository is written in C++, but it may also include C and Java once in a while. Don't expect much readable code from here, although I do try sometimes.

## Repository structure

### ./codeforces/

Directory in which all solutions are from problems that can be found on [*Codeforces*](https://codeforces.com/). The directory follows the following structure:

```
./(contest)/(problem letter)_(problem name in snake case).(file extension)
```

My profile can be found [here](https://codeforces.com/profile/Compl3x7).

### ./leet_code/

Directory in which all solutions are from [*LeetCode*](https://leetcode.com/) problems. The directory follows the following structure:

```
./(difficulty)/(problem number)_(problem name in snake case).(file extension)
```

My profile can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/u/Compl3x7/).

### ./other/

All solutions that don't exactly fit in any of the previously mentioned directories are put here. Naming may vary.
